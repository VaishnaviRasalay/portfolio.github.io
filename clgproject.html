    <h1> A Multi Objective
        Optimization Scheme For Job Scheduling in Sustainable Cloud Data
        Center</h1>
        <ul><h2><em>ABSTRACT</em></h2></ul>
        <li>For a number of years, due to an exponential increase in the demand for an ecofriendly environment, there has been a rapid increase in the green city revolution
            across the globe.</li> 
           <li>Subsequently, load shifting of major energy consumers fromconventional power grids to renewable energy sources(RES) has become inevitable. Towards this end, cloud data centers(DCs) have emerged as significant consumers of
               energy that solely rely on power grids to fuel their day-to-day operations.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, their energy consumption has increased significantly which in turn has
            substantially raised the global carbon footprint rate. </li>
            <li>These challenges can be best
            addressed by the judicious utilization of RES which have well established advantages
            like reduced operational costs and carbon emissions.</li>
            <li> Keeping in view of the above
            facts, the ultimate goal of the proposed work is to design a comprehensive workload
            classification; and job scheduling and Virtual machine architecture for cloud DCs
            powered by RES and power grids.</li>
            <li> For this, a multi-objective optimization scheme is
            proposed which operates in two phases.</li>
            <li>In phase I,a random forest-based wrapper
            scheme known as Boruta, is used for relevant feature set selection for the incoming
            workload.</li>
             <li>This is followed by classification of the workload using a locality sensitive
            hashing-based support vector machines approach. </li> 
            <li>In phase II, a multi-objective
            optimization problem for job scheduling and VM placement is formulated with
            respect to parameters such as service level agreement(SLA), energy cost, carbon
            footprint rate(CFR), and availability of RES.</li>
            <li> It is further solved using an enhanced
            heuristic approach based on a greedy strategy.</li>
            <li> Our experimental evaluations show an
            average improvement of approximately 31% in energy utilization, 28% in energy cost, and 36% in CFR, with a slight degradation in SLA assurance compared with the
            existing schemes</li>
